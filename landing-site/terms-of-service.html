        <p>By using the <strong>AOF Biz</strong> software and services, you agree to the following terms. Please read
            them
            carefully.</p>

        <h2>1. The Service</h2>
        <p>AOF Biz provides a local-first business management application for tracking orders, inventory, and expenses.
            The
            software is provided "as is" and "as available".</p>

        <h2>2. User Accounts</h2>
        <p>To access certain features (like Pro/Trial versions and Cloud Backup), you must authenticate with a Google
            Account. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Ownership & Responsibility</h2>
        <p>You retain full ownership of all business data entered into AOF Biz. Because your data is stored locally and
            on
            your personal Google Drive, we cannot recover data if you lose access to your device or delete files from
            your
            Google Drive.</p>

        <h2>4. Cloud Backup Feature</h2>
        <p>The Cloud Backup feature uses your Google Drive storage. You agree to allow AOF Biz to create and manage
            backup
            files in your Drive. We are not responsible for any storage costs or data loss within Google's services.</p>

        <h2>5. Pro & Trial Licensing</h2>
        <p>AOF Biz offers a free trial and a paid Pro plan. The trial is valid for 3 days. After the trial expires, Pro
            features will be disabled unless a valid license is linked to your account.</p>

        <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>In no event shall AOF Biz or its creators be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages
            for
            loss of data or profit) arising out of the use or inability to use the software.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of
            this
            page when we do so.</p>

        <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions regarding these terms, please contact us at <a
