    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: January 12, 2026</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>AOF Biz</strong>. Your privacy is critically important to us. This Privacy Policy describes
        how AOF Biz handles your personal information when you use our desktop application and associated services.</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>AOF Biz is designed with a "Local First" philosophy. Your business data (orders, inventory, expenses, quotations)
        is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>. We do not transmit your sensitive business data to our
        servers.</p>

    <h2>2. Google Drive Integration</h2>
    <p>AOF Biz offers an optional Cloud Backup feature. To enable this, we request access to your Google Drive via the
        following scope:</p>

    <div class="scope-box">
        <strong>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file</strong><br>
        <em>Permission requested: "See, edit, create, and delete only the specific Google Drive files you use with this
            app."</em>
    </div>

    <p><strong>How we use this data:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Backup:</strong> We create a encrypted backup file of your local database on your Google Drive.</li>
        <li><strong>Restore:</strong> We read the backup files created by AOF Biz to restore your data upon your
            request.</li>
        <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> We cannot see or access any other files in your Google Drive. We only have
            access to files created by the AOF Biz application.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Licensing & Identity</h2>
    <p>When you sign in with Google, we collect your <strong>Email address</strong>. This is used solely for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Verifying your subscription status (Pro/Trial).</li>
        <li>Providing customer support relative to your account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use <strong>Supabase</strong> as our identity proxy and licensing server. Supabase handles the authentication
        securely and does not have access to your private business data stored in your Google Drive.</p>

    <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us via our official website: <a
